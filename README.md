Welcome to the simple calculator. 
This are the things you can do:
* Do simple calculations with +, -, *, /, %%, ^
* In this version, the program runs calculations in order (not PEMDAS)
* Use the format -> num op num op num ...
* No other characters except operators mentioned and numbers are allowed
* Use 'ans' in the calculation to use the last calculation result, or to view the last answer
* Use 'hist' to view all the previous calculations
* Use 'exit' to quit the program
Enjoy!

This small project is made for me to learn about R language
